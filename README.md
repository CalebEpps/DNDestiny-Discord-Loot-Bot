Welcome to Sing's loot generator for Velvet Fang's DND re-imagining for Destiny!
This bot is still in early development but is mostly feature complete. If you have any issues, find me on Discord at Sing#8489, and I'll try to help out as I can. :)

# Features Available Right Now:
- Ability to generate a random piece of gear or weapon from Destiny 2's history.
- Ability to optionally specify the: season, class, rarity, and whether or not to roll on armor only
- All items roll to be in line with the DNDestiny rules (The perks match up and armor can be of type light, medium, or heavy)

# Features I'll be Adding Over Time:
- Ability to Specify weapon or armor type (bond, SMG, sidearm, mark, etc.)
- Support for Destiny 1 items
- More features for DNDestiny to make it easier to play online with friends
- Ability to save inventories (This one will be complex and may take some time)
- Better Result UI 

# Known Issues:
- Sometimes you may get a none roll. The cause is typically due to parameters in which no items fall into (Rare items from season 9, for example).
While I've tried to mitigate this issue, it may still happen occasionally
- Performance could be slightly better

Overall, I think it functions fairly well right now. If you have any issues not mentioned above, please let me know! I'm a CS student simply looking to expand my portfolio, so
everything I make will be free and open to anyone!
